## Projects
### Experimentation
1) [Simulating Bias through interaction effects in a ridesharing marketplace](https://github.com/MLMario/mariogj1987/blob/main/Simulation_Interaction_Effects_in_a_Ridesharing_Company.ipynb)
> This notebook simulates and analyzes data from an A/A and A/B test for a ride-sharing company, highlighting the challenges of measuring the true impact of a price drop amidst interaction effects. Various validation methods are explored to account for these complexities and offer potential insights.

### Data Analytics

### Casual Inference

1) [Causal Inference in Time Series: A Simple Demonstration Using Interrupted Time Series Analysis] (https://github.com/MLMario/mariogj1987/blob/main/ITSA_for_casual_time_series_analysis.ipynb)
> The notebook offers a hands-on demonstration of Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) for assessing causal effects in time series data. Using two scenarios—a basic time series and one with autocorrelation—it effectively evaluates the impact of a strategic price change on shipment demand. Autocorrelation presence and its implications are also thoroughly examined.

### Machine Learning
1) [Using Chat GPT to forecast Rwanda CO2 emissions](https://github.com/MLMario/mariogj1987/blob/main/Predicting_Carbon_Emission_in_Rwanda_using_Chat_GPT.ipynb)
> In this notebook I explore using chatpgt v4 with **light** prompting to try to guide me through making this predictions and ask it to write the code, for an article with more details and results, please look at this linkedin article
