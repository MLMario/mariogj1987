## Projects
### Experimentation
1) [Simulating Bias through interaction effects in a ridesharing marketplace](https://github.com/MLMario/mariogj1987/blob/main/Simulation_Interaction_Effects_in_a_Ridesharing_Company.ipynb)
> This notebook simulates and analyzes data from an A/A and A/B test for a ride-sharing company, highlighting the challenges of measuring the true impact of a price drop amidst interaction effects. Various validation methods are explored to account for these complexities and offer potential insights.

### Data Analytics

### Casual Inference

1) [Causal Inference in Time Series: A Simple Demonstration Using Interrupted Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/MLMario/mariogj1987/blob/main/ITSA_for_casual_time_series_analysis.ipynb)
> The notebook offers a hands-on demonstration of Interrupted Time Series Analysis (ITSA) for assessing causal effects in time series data. Using two scenarios—a basic time series and one with autocorrelation—it effectively evaluates the impact of a strategic price change on shipment demand. Autocorrelation presence and its implications are also thoroughly examined.

2) A clear primer on synthethic controls - Part 1 (Wip)

### Machine Learning
1) [Using Chat GPT to forecast Rwanda CO2 emissions](https://github.com/MLMario/mariogj1987/blob/main/Predicting_Carbon_Emission_in_Rwanda_using_Chat_GPT.ipynb)
> In this notebook I explore using chatpgt v4 with **light** prompting to try to guide me through making this predictions and ask it to write the code, for an article with more details and results, please look at this [Linkedin article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/can-chatgpt-participate-ml-competition-mario-garc%2525C3%2525ADa-jord%2525C3%2525A1n%3FtrackingId=KF91nD16MfD0Z16%252BsJ38RA%253D%253D/?trackingId=KF91nD16MfD0Z16%2BsJ38RA%3D%3D)

2) [Fine tuning Llama 2 with linkedin job posts to enhace my job search (In Progress)]
> In this notebook I attemp to train a pre-train version of Llama 2 - 7b model with web scrapped data from linkeding post. The objective is to train the Ai to recognize what skills and experience requirements are related with what jobs and then prompt it: "Given this set of skils (my skills) what jobs do you think are a good fit for me" This is a first attemp at making my job search smarter while learning more about LLM's. 

2.1 [Linkeding Scraper Python Class](https://github.com/MLMario/mariogj1987/blob/main/LinScraper.py)
> This is the code I use to download a dataset of jobs, including the title, link, and, more importantly, the job description for each job. Please use it as a reference point. LinkedIn doesn't generally allow people to scrape their site, so the XML seems to change relatively frequently and is not user-friendly.

2.2 Job Description Data processing for Fine Tuning Purpose
> In this notebook I show how I processed the data to suit our training (fine tuning) objective
