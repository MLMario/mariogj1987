At Unlearn, our purpose is to advance artificial intelligence (AI) to eliminate trial and error in medicine. We use AI to simulate potential health outcomes for individual patients. Today, we are reimagining the randomized control trial (RCT) for the 21st century through AI-powered clinical trials or TwinRCT. A TwinRCT allows more trial patients to receive the experimental treatment, reaches full enrollment faster and put patients first. Unlearn’s innovative work in AI today will reinvent how AI is applied in medicine tomorrow—and we have a top secret plan for how to get there. We won’t be able to achieve this mission just by applying technologies created by others; the future must be invented.

Unlearn is a technology company, not a biotech company. We use computers, not pipettes. We make and use software, we don’t discover or make drugs. We believe that AI will define the future of medicine, and we aren’t deterred by naysayers or skeptics.

We come from a variety of backgrounds ranging from machine learning to marketing—but regardless of where we come from, Unlearners share some common traits:

>> Unlearners are ambitious; we aren’t intimidated by big, challenging goals.
>> Unlearners are disciplined experimenters; we break down our big goals into smaller chunks and meet as often as necessary to track our velocity and iterate quickly.
>> Unlearners are gritty; we never give up, setbacks just make us try harder.
>> Unlearners are receptive to new ideas; in fact, we hate being stuck with the status quo.
>> Unlearners are storytellers; sharing information with each other and with the world is super important, too important to be boring. And, last but not least,

About Us

The Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability (SDSS) has a unifying goal of creating a future in which humans and nature thrive together in concert and in perpetuity. The school's unique three-part structure consisting of departments to drive scholarship and educate students, institutes to innovate across disciplines, and an accelerator to drive policy and technology solutions reimagines how universities can contribute to the planet's sustainability. We focus on creating knowledge and scaling solutions that benefit our local community and people globally, while also creating a school community that is inclusive of all people. For more information on the school please click here.

The Healthy Planet Healthy People Initiative

Housed within the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, the Healthy Planet Healthy People Initiative (HP2) will engage stakeholders across the Stanford community and beyond to co-develop solutions-oriented research, training, and education and to support the implementation of these solutions. Widespread ecological and environmental change has led to a crisis in biodiversity, a breakdown of important ecosystem processes, and a succession of major threats to human, wildlife, and domestic species health, ranging from poor water and air quality to food insecurity to infectious disease outbreaks. Land use change—in concert with climate change, increasing population growth and mobility, and growing inequality—threatens the functioning of ecosystems with major consequences for all living things. Reversing these negative trajectories requires community-engaged solutions based in systems science, which recognizes the interconnected nature of ecological and social processes and the wellbeing of all the planet’s inhabitants.

Research Scientist position

The position focuses on working with faculty leadership to build a research program for the Healthy Planet Healthy People Initiative that connects knowledge and action, scaling solutions, and engaging many stakeholders. The position will be based on Stanford campus in the Woods Institute for the Environment within the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and will be supervised by Dr. Erin Mordecai (Biology Department) and Dr. Giulio De Leo (Oceans and ESS Departments), both Senior Fellows with the Woods Institute.

Developing new protocols; testing and evaluating a variety of approaches.
Participating in creating new research proposals, and preparing for submission for funding and grants.
Preparing periodic progress reports or written reports on all phases of the research project.
Contributing original ideas of major methodologies that alter the course of the investigation or developing innovative solution(s) to complex research problems.
Performing ongoing literature review to remain current with new procedures and related research; proceeding without consultation with principal investigator to implement new techniques into research projects.

The Successful Applicant Will Need
Bachelor's degree in related scientific field and four years of relevant work experience; or Master’s degree in a related scientific field and two years relevant experience; or PhD in related science field such as ecology, epidemiology, environmental science, conservation, or other relevant fields.
Exceptional written and oral communication skills.
Extensive understanding of scientific principles.
Expert level knowledge and skills in a field of science related to the research project.
General computer skills, experience with databases and scientific applications, and ability to quickly learn and master computer programs.
Strong analytical skills and excellent judgment.
Ability to work under deadlines.
Excellent organizational skills and demonstrated ability to complete detailed work accurately.
Strong project management and leadership skills.

In the last few years, remote and hybrid work has had an explosion in popularity, giving workers an unprecedented level of access to opportunity and an increase in quality of life. However, our existing tools were not set up to do remote work well. Work can be isolating, transactional, and void of the camaraderie that makes everyone feel like they're in it together.

To solve this, Gather builds virtual offices that bring the best of in-person work to remote. We've already seen success with our approach, with over 10,000 remote-first companies using our spaces every day.

And yet it's still the early days for our broader vision of the Metaverse. We're excited about how the Metaverse can break down physical constraints that exist today, not just in where you can work, but which friends/family you can see, or what educational opportunities you can have access to.

Join us in this mission!

Role overview:

As a Senior Software Engineer within the Video team, you would take responsibility (along with a small team) for the design and implementation of this integral part of our video platform.

Video lies at the heart of the Gather experience, providing a low-latency, seamless experience for the spontaneous interactions we're known for. Our video infrastructure handles thousands of concurrent users, spanning all continents of the world.

Unlike traditional room-based video infrastructure, our video infra allows any two users to have an audio/video connection in an instant — enabling experiences where a speaker can address a large audience while the audience remains quiet to the speaker, yet the audience can still mingle amongst their neighbors, just like in real life. Our self-operated video infrastructure spans 5 data centers, and multiple clouds, and features an SFU design built in-house.

Where you will make an impact:

Deliver the tastiest, most appealing video frames our users' internet connections can endure
Optimize our video servers until they laugh with glee at the notion of having hundreds of simultaneous meeting participants
Degrade quality with grace for bandwidth or CPU-constrained devices, and handle spurious spikes in latency/congestion with a shout of ""Not today, internet weather!""
Build tools that guide us to our goal of an exceptionally reliable meeting platform
Instrument our service until it looks like a time-traveling Delorean you saw in those movies
Build automated tests that ensure the reliability and performance of our video infrastructure as we make it more awesome

What you bring:

Experience working on a large-scale group video calling platform (e.g. Zoom or Google Meet)
Experience working with WebRTC, either directly or with libraries that use it
Intrinsic motivation and drive to solve difficult problems without guidance
A keen intuition for well-designed software
Ability to thoughtfully stack your priorities in an ever-changing startup environment
Excellent interpersonal and communication skills

US Salary Range

At Gather, compensation may vary outside of this range depending on a number of factors, including a candidate's qualifications, skills, competencies and experience, and location. The base salary range for this position in the selected city is $144,000 - $193,500 annually and we encourage candidates outside of this salary range to apply.

Base pay is one part of the total package that is provided to compensate and recognize employees for their work, and this role may be eligible for a stock reward program.

Benefits

Work remotely out of a state-of-the-art virtual office!
Competitive compensation, benefits, and meaningful equity
Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance for employees and their dependents
401k and matching program
Generous PTO policy and mental health days to recharge
Meal stipend twice a week to keep you nourished
Remote work, education, and health & wellness stipend
Support for family planning & gender-affirmation
The opportunity to join a passionate team in building something that actually makes peoples' lives better, every single day

Gather is committed to building an inclusive and equitable workplace for individuals of all backgrounds. We strive to build a workplace where employees feel comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work, everyday. Qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender perception or identity, national origin, age, marital status, pregnancy or parental status, protected veteran status, disability status, or any other basis prohibited by law. Additionally, we're committed to providing access, equal opportunity and reasonable accommodation for individuals with disabilities in employment. If reasonable accommodation is needed to participate in the job application or interview process, to perform essential job functions, and/or to receive other benefits and privileges of employment, please notify the recruiter you are working with. We also ask that all applicants consider answering the voluntary demographic questions on our job application to help us track the inclusivity of our recruiting efforts and programs.

Here at Hinge Health, we welcome all applicants and know a diverse team makes us better and stronger. We look for individuals who embody our leadership principles and we value varied experiences and skill sets. Beyond specific work experience, we also look for unique capabilities and skill sets that are key indicators an applicant will thrive in our fast-paced, frequently evolving environment. If this sounds like the kind of place you’d like to be part of, please apply - we would love to hear from you!

Hinge Health Hybrid Model

We believe that remote work and in-person work have their own advantages and disadvantages, and we want to be able to leverage the best of both worlds. Some roles which require a greater degree of day-to-day collaboration will benefit from more in-person opportunities. Employees in hybrid roles are expected to be in office 1 day/week (Wednesdays) in hub locations that have an office, and will be expanded to 2 days/week in 2024.

About The Role

As Principal Engineer, you’ll help guide over a dozen small product teams responsible for delivering the world’s best remedy for chronic back and joint pain. You’ll elevate our high-quality, high-velocity execution by championing the right design principles, coaching on how to apply them, and baking systems of architectural governance into our daily workflow. In the year ahead, you’ll lead the graceful refactoring of a large ReactNative mobile app using module federation and utility encapsulation.

On a given day, you’ll author position pieces to change minds, technical architecture to align teams, reference material to ease implementation, and a dozen Slacks thanking teammates for being delightful, helpful, patient, and kind. You’ll share your opinions in pull requests, formal PE review sessions, weekly operational excellence meetings, and bi-weekly technical leadership sessions with the VPs, directors, PEs and CTO. You’ll write working code to prototype interesting solutions or handle the most demanding implementations, usually pairing with developers at every level to share your approach (and have more fun at work).

You’ll give high fives and shout outs, using your high station to celebrate great technical work and courageous, thoughtful risk-taking, and you’ll give hard feedback and bar-raising input in peer reviews, interviews, and strategic planning. You will make mistakes and model how to own them and learn from them, to reinforce a climate of high-accountability, innovation, and psychological safety.

You will report to the VP Engineering for Consumer Product Development, who will work to amplify your influence on the engineering culture as Hinge Health continues to rapidly scale. Your own pragmatism, collaborative spirit, technical prowess, and creative joy will bend the shape of a fast-growing organization, and directly influence our ability to give more deserving Americans access to better healthcare, faster.

The ideal candidate wants to do something that matters and make a profound difference in real people’s lives. You are energized by the pace and freedom of a fast-moving start-up, and have developed strong time-management and prioritization habits to avoid getting sucked into the maelstrom. You really like developing software for mobile phones and tablets, and have deep expertise in their unique capabilities and constraints. Ideally, you’ve spent a lot of time with ReactNative and Typescript, and have helped a dozen+ teams contribute to a 5-star app without stepping on each other’s toes.

We enjoy a continuous deployment DevOps culture, and take owner-operator pride in supporting our code in production with an on-call rotation. Rotations vary by team.

Our production systems rely on React Native, React, Node.js, Typescript, NestJS, GraphQL, Docker, Rails, Aptible, AWS, Postgres, Redis, Apollo, and Redux. Our workflow is trunk-based CI/CD, and our security/compliance posture is at the highest standards of healthcare, including HIPAA, HITRUST, SOC 2, and CCPA.

What You’ll Accomplish

You will shape the evolution of Hinge Health’s mobile app architecture, allowing several autonomous teams to ship dozens of new product capabilities every two weeks
You will design novel ways of using common tech to help millions of people feel less chronic pain in their daily lives
You will help teams manage risk and do just-enough planning to consistently deliver high-quality projects within budget
You will accelerate the professional development of technical leaders with attentive mentorship and active skills training
You will align hundreds of developers around well-defined principles and standards that make the codebase measurably better and easier to change
You will raise Hinge Health’s public profile, representing the team’s innovative work in technical articles and speaking engagements

Frontend application development on a large, complex, top-quality consumer application
Expertise in high performance computation, with an emphasis on profiling and bottleneck discovery with deep O(n)-driven intuitions
Expertise in low-latency, highly resilient client-server architecture, including graceful degradation of features in low- or no-bandwidth modes
Deep familiarity with the mobile app ecosystem, including testing, observing, deploying, and managing several concurrent versions in the field across a wide rage of consumer devices
Team-first, growth mindset, and ability to add leverage to every level of the org, from shipping code to shaping strategy with senior leadership
Track record of effective project management, primarily devoted to early derisking, problem decomposition, and a strong vision that pulls the team toward the destination together
Experience with agile techniques and tooling for rapid prototyping and experimentation
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or equivalent technical degree or equivalent experience

BONUS POINTS

Experience with ML at the edge, inc computer vision, NLP, and diagnostic AI
Experience in IoT, smart home, AR/VR, or wearables (especially ones using BLE)

Linktree’s Data Engineering team is at the forefront of transforming the way Linktree leverages data, working closely with the insights, data platform product and marketing teams to become truly data driven.

As a Staff Data Engineer at Linktree, you will be the driving force behind scaling how data is consumed at Linktree. Not only will you be modelling some of our most important data sets to gain insights, such as the data that helps us understand the driving factors behind the success of our product or our revenue, we take self-service one step further. You will also build the platform that can be used by Data Analysts, Marketers, Engineers and anyone else who is interested to model their own data to fit their specific needs and not be dependent on a data team.

This is your opportunity to make an impact at Linktree and push the boundaries of what is possible with data self-service!

Location Expectations: Hybrid. We're growing our team in LA and the Bay Area, and plan to have offices in both locations. We expect team members to come into their respective office 2x/week.

What You Will Do

Build the platform that allows data analysts, product managers, marketers and other heavy data users to model their own data as well as making that data available in tools of their choosing, such as product analytics tools, BI tools, an experimentation platform or our CRM system.
Continue leading the transformation to make data a first-class citizen in software development at Linktree. This includes defining standards and providing guidance to product teams who emit the vast majority of our data.
Build and maintaining robust, efficient and integrated data models. We don’t believe that Analytics Engineers should be painfully cleaning up after others and deal with bad data all day long, if you are faced with a “garbage in, garbage out” situation, you will work with the engineers in our product teams to come up with a better way to emit the raw data.
You will also provide support to other data users including peer-reviews, training and acting as a data modelling/SQL/dbt SME across various business initiatives.

What We Are Looking For

A platform mindset. Data teams main focus is not to do repetitive data transformation and integration jobs for others. The team builds the infrastructure and tools that allows Linktree to perform these tasks at scale by enabling all teams to perform data-related jobs themselves.
You understand data-driven product development and have experience with the typical tools used by high-performing product teams, such product analytics, experimentation, but also general purpose BI tools.
Experience in data modelling with the ability to translate business requirements to fit for purpose data products for critical use-cases (reporting to the board, understanding key drivers of product success).
Experience operating at scale. You have worked on data systems that power a product that serves hundreds of millions of active users.
Proficient in SQL and experience with working on cloud-based warehouses (experience in Snowflake is a bonus), as well as working with DBT.

Linktree is committed to providing a competitive compensation package. Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $175,000-$225,000 in the San Francisco Bay or Los Angeles area. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate expertise, the scope of role and level, and may vary from the amounts listed above.

Where And How We Work

We are a global and diverse group offering a truly flexible and family friendly work environment. Kids, pets, and the occasional delivery person are all actively encouraged to appear on our Zoom screens. All of us at Linktree work either fully remote or a hybrid ""remote, but in-office sometimes"" approach.

We currently have offices in Melbourne, Sydney and LA, but our team is spread across Australia, United States, and New Zealand. As our team approaches 200 people, our company will be 10x the size we were in 2020.

We offer autonomy and flexibility in how you structure your days and weeks. There will be the need for some collaboration outside of a ""normal"" 9-5 being a global company, but we aim to work asynchronously where possible.

Our Culture And Benefits

Linktree's company culture and values are based around collaboration, diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give you some more specific examples:

We recognize that our teammates are individually unique and have designed our benefits with this in mind. Each employee has an annual allowance to use on things like (but not limited to) fitness memberships, development courses, childcare, travel, charitable donations, pet insurance, home office set up - the choice is yours!
We provide top-flight medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance - we cover 100% of your monthly premiums (and 80% for your dependents).
401k matching up to 6%.
Employee Stock Option Program - we want each and every employee to share in the company’s success as we go further together.

And Meraki's hardware organization is responsible for building the physical devices that get people online.

Meraki is looking for a Senior Data Engineer to join Cisco Wireless & Meraki Hardware’s Analytics and Data Science Team. As a Data Engineer, you will be a key partner in Meraki’s hardware analytics ecosystem and at the center of our data.

To do so, you’ll work directly with external companies we partner with to build and expand on data pipelines that allow for the transfer of vital data between companies. As part of this role, you will also develop relationships across engineering teams such as quality, operations, and manufacturing at Meraki.

Ideal candidates will have strong communication skills, an analytical mindset, excellent organizational skills, and a bias to action. You don't wait for change - you embody the change you want to see in the world!

Cisco believes that the quality of our product is dependent on the quality of our employees. We place a high value on nurturing the growth and development of everyone on our team. We foster an open and supportive workplace where everybody is given the opportunity to succeed.

A new data error has appeared in our data and caused the daily pipeline run to fail. Identify and resolve the issue, and then build a test to check for similar issues going forward. What can be done to prevent this issue from happening again?
A manufacturing partner is opening up a new factory site. Work with the team at the partner company to expand our pipeline to add data from this new site to our systems.
A stakeholder is requesting that a new data source be added to our platform. Take point in bringing that new source into the team's core data tables: understand how the new data relates and connects to the existing data, write the scripts to bring them together, and build relevant tests to check the integrity of the data on an ongoing basis.

Requirements & Qualifications:

5+ years experience with SQL
3+ years experience with Python
2+ years experience with data visualization tools (e.g. Tableau)
1+ year experience working with core statistical concepts (e.g. correlation, causation, regression analysis)

Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation.
